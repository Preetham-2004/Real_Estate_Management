# Real Estate Management is a web platform centered around backend operations, facilitating the management of real estate data. It exemplifies the utilization of RESTful API methodologies, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, for seamless data manipulation. A form interface has been integrated to illustrate these capabilities, enabling users to retrieve and render property details, append new entries, modify existing records, and expunge data as required.
